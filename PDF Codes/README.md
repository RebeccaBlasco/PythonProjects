These codes utilize Python to manipulate PDFs. 
  {Code 1} PDF - App that Reads PDF is pretty self explanatory. It uses 2 libraries (pyttsx3 and PyPDF2) to read the PDF.
  {Code 2} PDF - Merge All PDF from a folder uses 2 libraries (PyPDF2 and os) to merge PDFs that are in one folder
  {code 3} PDF - Split PDF Range of ages SolutionFile_Module4_Assignment2 allows you to essentially pull out of a chunk of a PDF and put in into a new PDF. This file only uses one library (PyPDF2).
  {Code 4} PDF - Split PDF separate pages SolutionFile_Module4_Assignment1.py is same as code 3, but alows you to pull out single pages (1, 5 and 13) rather than sequential chunks. It uses the same libraries.
  {Code 5} PDF - mergeTwoPDF merges two PDFs into one new PDF. It uses one library (PyPDF2)
